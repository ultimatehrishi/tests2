# Write a program to generate fibonacci series using recurssion ( No Use of Loops)
    Fab Series = 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ....

    def fab(length):
        return series

    Example-input
    fab(4)
    Example-output
    [1,1,2,3]

    Example-input
    fab(6)
    Example-output

# Write a program file "tail.py" which works for these scenarios

    tail.py -5 file1.txt  - should give the last 5 lines of the file file1.txt

    tail.py -3 file3.txt  - should give last 3 lines of file file3.txt

    tail.py 3 file.txt  - should give first 3 lines of file.txt

    tail.py -10 file1.txt -20 file2.txt - should give last 10 lines of file1.txt and last 20 lines of file file2.txt

    tail.py file.text - Full content of the file
